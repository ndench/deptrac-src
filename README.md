# Deptrac

Deptrac is a static code analysis tool for PHP that helps you communicate,
visualize and enforce architectural decisions in your projects. You can freely
define your architectural layers over classes and which rules should apply to
them.

For example, you can use Deptrac to ensure that bundles/modules/extensions in
your project are truly independent of each other to make them easier to reuse.

Deptrac can be used in a CI pipeline to make sure a pull request does not
violate any of the architectural rules you defined. With the optional Graphviz
or Mermaidjs formatter you can visualize your layers, rules and violations.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation in the /docs directory or visit the doc page:
https://qossmic.github.io/deptrac

## Getting Started

You can install Deptrac via Composer. We recommend using the
[deptrac](https://github.com/qossmic/deptrac) package for this:

```console
composer require --dev qossmic/deptrac
```

Once you have downloaded/installed deptrac, you will need to create a
[configuration file](docs/index.md#configuration), where you define your layers and
communication ruleset. This configuration file is written in YAML or php and, by default,
is stored with the name `deptrac.yaml` in your project's root directory.

Deptrac can generate a template for you, using the `init` command.

```console
vendor/bin/deptrac init
```

When you have this file, you can analyse your code by
running the `analyse` command:

```console
vendor/bin/deptrac

# which is equivalent to
vendor/bin/deptrac analyse --config-file=deptrac.yaml
```

In order to run Deptrac you need at least PHP 8.1.

You can analyse projects that require an older PHP version as long as
[nikic/php-parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) can parse it.
